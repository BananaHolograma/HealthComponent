Effortlessly simulate health and damage for entities within your video game.

This component handles all aspects related to taking damage and managing health on the parent node. While typically added to a `CharacterBody2D`, there are no limitations preventing its use with a `StaticRigidBody2D`, allowing you to imbue life into objects like trees or other in-game elements.
